MONGODB - DATABASE
--------------------

Database used to store and manage data permenantly (fireBase, mySQL, SQL, MSAcess, MongoDB, Oracle...).

MongoDB is a NoSQL Database, data stored as JSON documents it's stored in memory as BSON data
    ({"key":value}), To store multiple JSON documents is known as Collection.

Difference b/w SQL & MongoDB
    SQL                         MongoDB
~ Relational SQL DBMS        ~ Document oriented NoSQL DBMS
~ Data stored in Table,      ~ Data stored in Collection,
    every table must have           as JSON document
    rows and fixed columns
~ uses fixed schema          ~ uses dynamic schema
~ Support rich set of data   ~ Limited set of data types
  types
~ Uses in Traditional        ~ used in big data and real time app
  buisness app
~ Optimised for complex      ~ Optimised for scalability & perfomance 
  join and transaction

MongoDB in the following environments:-
    MongoDB Atlas: The fully managed service for MongoDB deployments in the cloud
    MongoDB Enterprise: The subscription-based, self-managed version of MongoDB
    MongoDB Community: The source-available, free-to-use, and self-managed version of MongoDB

MongoDB shell / mongosh is terminal used to write mongodb codes
Collection used to store JSON documents, to name a Collection use only small letters and it should be plural format
MongoDB generate a unique value to identify each collection using _id key and its value is a hexadecimal value

CRUD Operations performed in MongoDB
  To get/read a single document from MongoDB collection: use findOne({key: value})
  find() to get/read all documents from collection
  insertOne({key:value}) to insert single document to collection
  insertMany([{key:value},{key:value},...]) to insert multiple documents to collection  
  countDocument() to get total count of documents in a collection 
  limit(count) to limit documents while getting from a collection
  skip(count) to skip documents while getting from a collection
  sort({key:1/-1}) to sort documents while getting from a collection
  find({key:{$gt/$gte/$lt/$lte/$eq/$neq/$exists}})
